# DATA205 Capstone Project
This is my capstone project for DATA205 Spring 2025 at Montgomery College.

## Project Overview
This project goes over what factors might affect the population of White-Tailed deer in three national parks:
- Arkansas Post National Memorial, AR
- Pea Ridge National Military Park, AR
- Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, MO
The code explores weather variables, vegetation type, and human populations surrounding the parks.
